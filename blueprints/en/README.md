# 🏗️ Blueprints (Solution Models)

[← Back to index](../../)

---

## What are Blueprints?

**Blueprints** are solutions that have matured.

They are **generalized, flexible, agnostic** to project, time, and even stack.

When a solution works so well that it can be replicated,
it becomes a **Blueprint**.

---

## Why do Blueprints matter?

- **Accelerate the team**: you don't start from scratch
- **Guarantee quality**: they've been tested and refined
- **Create legacy**: your work lives beyond a specific project
- **Recognize authorship**: each Blueprint brings its Hero

---

## How does something become a Blueprint?

A Blueprint is born when:

1. A solution **solves a problem well**
2. The problem **repeats in other contexts**
3. The solution is **generalized** to be reusable
4. The documentation is **clear enough** for someone to apply it alone

**Every Solution has potential to become a Blueprint.**
**Here we make it happen.**

---

## Expected structure

Each Blueprint should contain:

- **Blueprint name**
- **Hero (Author)**: who created, tested, and refined it
- **Problem it solves**: context and application
- **How it works**: architecture/general logic
- **How to use**: implementation guide
- **Real examples**: where it's already been applied
- **Variations**: possible adaptations

---

## How to contribute?

1. **Identify** a solution of yours that can be generalized
2. **Document** it clearly and replicably
3. **Include your name as Hero** — you deserve the credit
4. **Share with the team** for review and improvement

---

**Blueprints are our living catalog of excellence.**
**Each one tells a story of a problem well solved.**
