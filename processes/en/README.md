## What are Processes?

**Processes** are operational maps of DJIN.

They show how work connects between people and departments,
what each stage delivers and what the next one expects to receive.

They serve to provide **real visibility**:
where you are, what you have available, and where your work goes next.

Understanding Processes means understanding the **living system of the company** —
and how your contribution moves everything around you.

---

## What are they for?

- **Give clarity**: know what you receive and what you should deliver
- **Connect people**: understand how your work impacts the next person
- **Avoid blockers**: identify where the flow gets stuck and why
- **Create autonomy**: when you know the process, you make better decisions

---

## How to use?

1. **Consult** when starting something new
2. **Refine** when you notice something has changed or can improve
3. **Share** when someone on the team needs context

---

## Expected structure

Each process should contain:

- **Process name**
- **Objective**: what it solves
- **Steps**: simplified flow
- **Inputs and outputs**: what each stage expects and delivers
- **Responsible parties**: who takes care of each part
- **Points of attention**: where it usually gets stuck or goes wrong

**They exist to give clarity and autonomy.**
