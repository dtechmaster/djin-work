# 🔄 QA-P-0001 — End-to-End Quality Assurance Process

[← Back to Processes](../README.md)

---

## 📌 Objective

This process defines the complete Quality Assurance (QA) flow at DJIN, from initial client intake to final validation before delivery.

QA operates at **two critical points**:
- **QA[1]** — Intake triage (ensures minimum requirements)
- **QA[2]** — Final validation (ensures delivery quality) *(to be defined)*

---

## ✅ High-Level Flow

```mermaid

    A[Client] --> QA1["QA[1] Intake / Triage"]
    QA1 --> ARQ[Architecture]
    ARQ --> ENG[Engineering]
    ENG --> QA2["QA[2] (Final Validation - TBD)"]
    QA2 --> C[Client]
```

---

## 🧪 QA[1] — Initial Triage

### Objective

Ensure that **minimum necessary information** is present before forwarding to Architecture.

Prevents rework, bottlenecks, and time waste with incomplete or ambiguous requirements.

### Responsible

**DJIN Member (QA)** — Any DJIN Member assigned to the QA role executes this process.

### Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD

    A["Client sends information"] --> B["Reception - DJIN QA"]

    B --> C["Initial triage
Apply QA-ST-0002"]

    C -->|Minimum requirements OK| D["Forward to Architecture"]
    C -->|Minimum requirements NOT met| E["Send Fallback Message"]
    
```

### Tools

* [**QA-ST-0002**](../../../standards/en/QA/QA-ST-0002.md) — QA Department Quality Standard (Operational Version)
* [**QA-ST-0002 Assistant**](TODO) — Initial Triage Assistant

## 🔍 QA[2] — Final Validation

### Objective

*(To be defined)*

Ensure the final product meets quality criteria before delivery to the client.

### Responsible

**DJIN Member (QA)** — Any DJIN Member assigned to the QA role executes this process.

### Flow

*(To be defined)*

## 🧠 Why This Process Works

Because:

* **Reduces waste** — avoids work without clear requirements
* **Increases velocity** — Architecture and Engineering receive quality input
* **Protects the client** — guarantees validated and reliable deliveries
* **Creates predictability** — each stage knows what to expect
