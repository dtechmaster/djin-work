## The purpose

This program doesn't buy hardware.
It **trains future DJIN leaders**.

It's how the company invests heavily in those demonstrating:

* structural intelligence
* consistency
* real HEART
* cultural impact
* vision
* autonomy
* ability to multiply value

---

## What DJIN can sponsor

* advanced hardware kits
* GPUs
* high-level courses
* powerful machines
* laboratory tools
* trips to Japan
* relocation assistance
* conferences
* maker equipment
* micro research grants

## Who receives

**DJIN Members** who accumulate **real merit**, not flattery.
People growing fast and aligned with DJIN's future.

Any DJIN Member — from any department (QA, Engineering, Architecture, Support, Sales) — is eligible for Sponsorship.

## How it works

Sponsorship only happens when the **DJIN Member**:

* Demonstrates solid HEART
* Has a history of intelligent deliveries
* Creates value that multiplies for the entire company
* Accumulates **Sponsorship Points**

**DJIN Sponsorship is investment, not benefit.**

---

**Sponsorship → accelerates future leaders.**
