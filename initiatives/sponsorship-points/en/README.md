# 🧠 Sponsorship Points — The meritocratic metric of genius

[← Back to index](../../../)

---

> **⚠️ Important Notice:** This initiative is currently available **only for Brazilian team members**. We plan to expand to other regions in the future.

---

## The purpose

Create an honest and transparent system that identifies **true intelligence**, not dumb productivity.

Sponsorship Points recognize:

* applied genius
* architectural insights
* intelligent generalizations
* out-of-the-box thinking
* long-term vision
* contributions that change the company's baseline

**They are rare.**
**They are valuable.**
**And they determine who will be the next sponsored.**

## How to earn points

There are **two ways**:

### 1) Diamond in DJIN Inspire

Extraordinary work published externally.
**(= Gold + 1 Sponsorship Point)**

### 2) Genius Recognition (Architecture)

When someone, in daily work, demonstrates:

* ability to **generalize** an instance problem
* reduce complexity from O(n) → O(log n)
* transform workarounds into architecture
* anticipate future problems
* create solutions that become Standards or Blueprints
* identify hidden patterns
* save future time/energy for the entire team
* raise the company's bar

These moments are rare by nature —
precisely why they deserve **Sponsorship Points**.

---

## Why it exists

Because DJIN doesn't want to train operators.
It wants to train **architects, researchers, inventors, and technical leaders**.

Points show who is truly ready to receive deep investment.

**Sponsorship Points → measure genius.**
