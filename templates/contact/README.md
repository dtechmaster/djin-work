# Contact Templates — DJIN Work

This folder defines how external parties must contact DJIN Tech regarding the DJIN Work framework.

Emails that **do not follow these templates** may be ignored automatically.

## Available Templates
- `usage-support.md` — Requests for usage help, consulting, or implementation support.
- `work-with-us.md` — Professionals or teams applying to collaborate with DJIN Tech.

## Mandatory Subject Line Convention
To ensure automated routing and noise reduction, all emails must follow:

```
[DJIN-WORK][CATEGORY] — <Short Summary>
```

### Examples

- `[DJIN-WORK][CAREERS] — Senior TypeScript Engineer`

## Core Rules

3. English only for external requests.
4. DJIN reserves the right to ignore or refuse any request.
