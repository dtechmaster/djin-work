## What are Solutions?

We are **"DJIN Tech Solutions"** for a reason:
our mission is to create **technology solutions**,
not just write code.

A solution can be a component, an app, a complete system,
or even custom-made hardware — wearable, drone, sensor, instrument.
**Technology for us is an entire field, not just a piece.**

Here, full-stack means from server to Raspberry Pi,
from digital to physical,
from idea to real impact.

## Our philosophy

And we always ask:

- **Can this solution evolve into something bigger?**
- **Can we generalize it to solve future problems too?**

Well-made solutions become **Blueprints**.
This is how we value our time and create legacies.

**Here, everyone owns their solutions. Love them. Own your work.**

## What is a good solution?

A good solution:

- **Solves the real problem**, not the imagined one
- **Is understandable**: others understand how it works
- **Is maintainable**: can be adjusted in the future
- **Has generalization potential**: can become a Blueprint
- **Delivers value**: positively impacts those who use it

## How to document your solutions?

Each solution should include:

- **Clear name and description**
- **Problem it solves**
- **How it works** (technical overview)
- **How to use** (practical examples)
- **Known limitations**
- **Evolution potential**: can it become a Blueprint?

**Solutions aren't just code.**
**They're intelligent answers to real problems.**
