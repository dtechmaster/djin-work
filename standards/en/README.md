# 🎯 Standards

## What are Standards?

**Standards** are what make us different.

Here we define our way of working: modern, pragmatic, and battle-tested —
not based on trends or manuals created far from practice.

Our standards exist to balance **DX** and **UX**,
and deliver **Real Technology**: useful, functional, and with real impact.

Each Standard naturally becomes a **simple checklist**,
easy to follow and always with DJIN's identity.

## What are they for?

- **Maintain consistent quality** without depending on "goodwill"
- **Accelerate decisions**: you already know what to do
- **Facilitate code review**: everyone follows the same principles
- **Scale the team**: new members learn quickly

---

## How to use?

1. **Consult** before starting something new
2. **Follow** whenever possible — they're standards, not suggestions
3. **Question** if something doesn't make sense — standards evolve
4. **Propose** new standards when you notice repetitions

---

## Expected structure

Each Standard should contain:

- **Clear name**: e.g., "Vue Component Structure"
- **Context**: when to apply
- **Rules**: what to do and what to avoid
- **Examples**: good code vs bad code
- **Checklist**: quick validation points

---

**Standards don't exist to make things rigid.**
**They exist to elevate the level of everything we do.**
