## What are Mental Models?

**Mental Models** are the glasses through which we see the world.

They transform the complicated into simple,
and the simple into powerful.

Here we share our **ways of thinking** —
perspectives that align the team and create deep understanding
without effort and without friction.

---

## Why do they matter?

- **Align the team**: everyone sees the problem the same way
- **Accelerate communication**: a shared model is worth more than a thousand words
- **Elevate decisions**: better lenses, better choices
- **Create culture**: the DJIN way of thinking

**Each Mental Model should include its author (Hero),
because every way of seeing the world comes from someone.**

---

## How to use?

1. **Study** existing models to understand how we think
2. **Apply** them in your daily decisions and conversations
3. **Share** when you notice a model helped you
4. **Create** new models when you discover a powerful perspective

---

## Expected structure

Each Mental Model should contain:

- **Model name**: short and memorable
- **Hero (Author)**: who brought or created this model
- **What it is**: clear and direct explanation
- **When to use**: application contexts
- **Practical examples**: real cases where it helps
- **Traps**: when NOT to use or necessary precautions

---

## How to contribute?

1. **Identify** a way of thinking that constantly helps you
2. **Formalize** it in a clear and replicable format
3. **Include your name as Hero** — you deserve the credit
4. **Share with the team** for discussion and refinement

---

**When we share these models,
we learn together, refine together,
and improve the product as a natural consequence of our culture.**

**Aligned mental models create teams that think together —
and build things impossible alone.**
