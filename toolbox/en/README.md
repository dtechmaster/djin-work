# 🛠️ Toolbox (Approved Tools)

[← Back to index](../../)

## What is the Toolbox?

The digital world rarely learns from the real world.
**At DJIN, we do it differently.**

In an **operating room**, no one brings their own scalpel.
The right tools are already there —
prepared, sterilized, standardized
and chosen because they guarantee **precision, safety, and quality**.

The **Toolbox** follows this principle:
a set of approved, tested, and fine-tuned tools
for you to work fast, with confidence,
and without wasting time choosing instruments every day.

---

## Why does this matter?

- **Eliminates decision fatigue**: you don't waste energy choosing tools
- **Guarantees compatibility**: everything works together
- **Facilitates collaboration**: everyone uses the same tools
- **Accelerates onboarding**: new members already know what to use
- **Maintains quality**: tested tools, not bets

---

## How to use?

1. **Consult** when you need a new tool
2. **Use** the approved tools whenever possible
3. **Propose** new tools if you identify gaps
4. **Question** if something isn't working well

---

## Expected structure

Each tool should include:

- **Tool name**
- **Category**: frontend, backend, DevOps, design, etc.
- **What it's for**: problem it solves
- **Why we chose it**: advantages over alternatives
- **How to get started**: quick setup guide
- **References**: official docs, internal guides

---

## Proposing new tools

Before proposing, answer:

1. **What problem does it solve** that current ones don't?
2. **Why is it better** than alternatives?
3. **What's the cost** of adoption (time, learning curve, license)?
4. **How does it integrate** with what we already use?

### Quality Assurance

- **[QA-ST-0001 Checklist](../QA-ST-0001/checklist-en.md)** — Test and quick verification checklist
  _Associated with: [QA-ST-0001 Standard](../../standards/en/QA/QA-ST-0001.md)_

**The Toolbox doesn't exist to limit choices.**
**It exists to ensure we always have the right instruments at hand.**
